New Feature: ocelotgui will run on Microsoft Windows (32-bit)

Although Ocelot does not supply a package for Windows,
it can be built from source files as of 2016-06-14.
You will need Qt, CMake, MySQL, and ocelotgui source.

For Qt: Go to www.qt.io/download-open-source
    Avoid/skip any suggestion to login -- there can be no special license
    After installation is complete, you should have Qt in
    something like C:\Qt\Qt5.6.1 and MinGW compiler gcc.exe in
    c:\Qt\Qt5.6.1\Tools\mingw492_32\bin\gcc.

For MySQL: it's simplest to install the whole package,
    although the only things necessary here are the
    client shared library and the usual include files.
    After installation is complete, you should have mysql.h in
    C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.7\include\mysql.h

For CMake: go to cmake.org/download
    When asked whether to add Cmake to the system path, say yes.

For ocelotgui: go to github.com/ocelot-inc/ocelotgui
    You need to make sure you are getting recent source
    with the patches done on or after June 14 2016,
    so use the version 1.0.3 "release" files,
    earlier "release" files will not work. An
    easy choice is git clone (to install git, see git-scm.com/downloads).
    git clone https://github.com/ocelot-inc/ocelotgui.git c:\ocelotgui

cd c:\ocelotgui
SET PATH=C:\Qt\qt5.6.1\Tools\mingw492_32\bin;C:\Qt\qt5.6.1\Tools\mingw492_32\lib;C:\Qt\qt5.6.1\5.6\mingw49_32\bin;%path%
cmake . -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DMYSQL_INCLUDE_DIR="C:/Program Files/MySQL/MySQL Server 5.7/include"
mingw32-make
And now there should be a file named c:\ocelotgui\ocelotgui.exe.
This has the same functionality as the Linux ocelotgui program,
but has not been tested on all major Windows versions.
When connecting, use protocol=tcp.
Connection should work to any modern MySQL or MariaDB server.
